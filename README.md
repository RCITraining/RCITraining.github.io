# README 
The RCI Training pages provide training materials on topics relevant to Research Computing and Imaging. You can read it here: https://rcitraining.github.io/ on our github web pages. If you are currently reading this you are viewing our github repository where all the materials are created and collated.

## Introduction
The Research Computing and Imaging comes from an EPSRC funded fellowship. Imaging requires software that is often visual and uses computer graphics which can be difficult to explain in linear text so these materials also make use of video so that the multiple scenes and how the relate to actions in the Graphical User Interface can be seen together.
